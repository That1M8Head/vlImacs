** A personal Emacs config 

VlImacs is my personal Emacs config, containing stuff that I want Emacs to have because I like Emacs and it's cool. /But Vim is cool too, so this config includes Evil./

This config includes stuff that I personally like and use a lot. It may be useful to others.

The main reason I made this config and put it up here is because Emacs' defaults are... /okay/.
Not only in terms of functionality, but also aesthetics. It doesn't look that great out of the box, at least for me.
Putting my config up here means I can do a simple =git clone= and easily have my desired config wherever I have internet access and an Emacs installation.

*** Why "vlImacs"?
I needed a name, and I'm not good at coming up with names.
So I randomly came up with it.

*** Why not just use Spacemacs or Doom Emacs?
Bloat. jk

I do like Doom Emacs (a lot) but it kind of takes forever to install. With a lightweight config, all I need to do is =git clone= and I've already got a working setup. Plus, this way I can add stuff to it as I go.
