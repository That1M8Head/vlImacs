Welcome to Arsalan Kazmi <that1m8head>'s epic(ally basic) Emacs config!

This config uses Evil.
To temporarily disable it: M-x evil-mode RET

Key
==========================================
  C = Control
  M = Meta/Alt
RET = Enter/Return

Example: "Ctrl+X, K" means "C-x k"

Common Emacs Shortcuts
==========================================
C-x C-s     -   Write to the currently opened file.
C-x C-w     -   Write to a specific file, essentially "Save As".
C-x C-f     -   Search for and open a file.

M-x         -   Run a command by name. (Evil command mode works too)
C-g	        -	  Cancel the current operation.
C-h         -   Get help.

C-k         -   Kill (cut) a line or the selected text.
M-w         -   Same as above, but do not delete text (essentially 'Copy').
C-y         -   Yank (paste) text from the kill ring.

C-x 1	      -   Kill all windows except the active one.
C-x 2	      -	  Split windows vertically.
C-x 3	      -	  Split windows horizontally.

C-x b       -   Switch buffers.
