#+TITLE: Arsalan Kazmi's Emacs config
#+AUTHOR: Arsalan Kazmi <That1M8Head>

** An unnamed Emacs config tailored to... just what I like.

This is my personal Emacs config, containing stuff that I'm just experimenting with for Emacs because Emacs is cool.
But Vim is cool too, so this config includes Evil.

This config is good for me. It might be good for anyone else, but it might not be. I don't know.

The main reason I made this config and put it up here is because Emacs' defaults are... /okay/.
Not only in terms of functionality, but also aesthetics. It doesn't look that great out of the box, at least for me.
Putting my config up here means I can do a simple =git clone= and easily have my desired config
wherever I have internet access and Emacs. *Boom, instant.*

*** Why not just use Spacemacs or Doom Emacs?
Bloat. jk

I do like Doom Emacs (a lot) but it kind of takes forever to install. With a lightweight config, all I need to do is =git clone= and I've already got a working setup. Plus, this way I can add stuff to it as I go.

*** List of functions currently in this config
#+BEGIN_SRC
set-light-mode - Set the colour scheme to a light mode.
set-dark-mode  - Set the colour scheme to a dark mode.
#+END_SRC
