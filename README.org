** A personal Emacs config
vlImacs (pronounced "vlee-macs") is my personal Emacs config, containing stuff that I want Emacs to have because I like Emacs and it's cool. /But Vim is cool too, so this config includes Evil./
    
(Yes, I use Doom Emacs sometimes, but I still really like tinkering with Emacs sfhslffhgdc)

*** Why "vlImacs"?
I needed a name, and I'm not good at coming up with names.
So I randomly came up with it.
