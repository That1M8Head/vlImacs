Welcome to Arsalan Kazmi <that1m8head>'s epic Emacs config! No longer basic.

This config uses Evil.
To temporarily disable it: M-x evil-mode RET

Key
==========================================
  C = Control
  M = Meta/Alt
RET = Enter/Return

Example: C-x k means you press Control+x, then k.
Keys are case sensitive.
